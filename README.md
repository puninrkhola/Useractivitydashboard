🧑‍💻 UserActivityDashboard

A simple and clean React-based dashboard that displays user activity status using reusable components and basic styling.

📘 What I Learned & Implemented

⚛️ React Fundamentals  
• JSX: Used to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.  
• Functional Components: Built `App.jsx`, `UserList.jsx`, and `UserCard.jsx` as modular units.  
• Fragments: Used to wrap multiple elements without adding extra DOM nodes.  
• JSX Curly Braces: Injected JavaScript expressions inside JSX tags.  

📦 Props & Data Flow  
• Props: Passed data from parent to child components.  
• Array as Props: Sent a user data array to render multiple components.  
• Dynamic Rendering: Used `.map()` to render user cards based on the user list.  
• Conditional Rendering: Displayed different status badges (`Active` / `Inactive`) based on a boolean.  

🧠 Concepts Reinforced  
• Import & Export: Clean separation of logic using proper module imports.  
• Component Reusability: Designed `UserCard` to be reused for each user.  
• Separation of Concerns: Divided logic and UI into different files.  

🎨 Styling  
• Basic CSS: Styled components using `App.css`.  
• Inline Styles: Applied conditional color to status badges based on activity.

✅ Outcome

This mini-project helped me understand the basics of React, working with props, component-based design, and dynamic rendering using an array of objects.  
It gave me confidence to build more complex UIs in the future.
